# Victor's Computer Vision Toolkit
Here I'll push some Jupyter Notebooks with studies and analysis I've made on computer vision libraries.

### Attention
For all notebooks to properly work you must download the following resources and unpack it (if necessary) to the assets folder:

* [Dlib Facial Landmarks Predictor Model](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz) based on V. Kazemi, S. Josephine, One millisecond face alignment with an ensemble of regression trees, in: 27th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2014, Columbus, United States, 23 June 2014 through 28 June 2014, IEEE Computer Society, 2014, pp. 1867â€“1874.
